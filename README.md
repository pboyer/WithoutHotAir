# Purpose

David JC MacKay wrote a great book called "Sustainable Energy - without the hot air". I loved reading it, but as an American, I was frustrated. McKay - a professor at the University of Cambridge - wrote his book for the UK, not for the United States. Although the US is a dominant energy user, there is simply no book providing an practical introduction to sustainable energy for the United States.

Until now, that is.
